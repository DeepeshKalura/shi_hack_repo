# Smart Transportation System - Smart India Hackathon

## Idea Abstraction

The Smart Transportation System is an innovative solution designed to empower organizations with real-time vehicle tracking capabilities. This project aims to provide organizations with a reliable platform to manage and monitor their fleet of vehicles efficiently. By enabling real-time tracking, it enhances operational control and ensures a safer and more efficient transportation network.

## Idea Working Model

The Smart Transportation System consists of four key actors:

1. **Developer**:
   - Provides registration and onboarding for organizations.
   - Offers access to the tracking system.

2. **Organization**:
   - Provides data about their fleet, including operators (drivers or conductors), vehicle information, and routes.
   - Data is securely stored on a server.

3. **Operator**:
   - Operators can access the system for live tracking information.
   - Live location data is made available to them.

4. **User**:
   - Users can consume live tracking information provided by operators.
   - Access to real-time location streaming.

## Tech Stack

Our project leverages a powerful tech stack to deliver this innovative transportation solution:

1. **Google Maps (Google Cloud)**: Utilized for accurate and real-time mapping and location services.

2. **Flutter**: A cross-platform UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile, web, and desktop.

3. **Android**: The Android platform serves as a key component of our mobile application development.

4. **Firebase**: Used for real-time data synchronization, authentication, and cloud-based services.

5. **FastAPI**: A modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

6. **React**: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces, ensuring an interactive and dynamic user experience.

7. **Node.js**: An open-source, server-side runtime environment that allows us to build scalable and high-performance network applications.
